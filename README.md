# Understanding Academic Collaboration Networks on arXiv

üîó **Website:** [https://nsproject12.my.canva.site/](https://nsproject12.my.canva.site/)

## Overview

This project explores the **temporal evolution**, **interdisciplinary nature**, and **predictive modeling** of academic collaborations on the [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/) platform. Using a graph-based approach on a snapshot of arXiv metadata, we analyze how co-authorship networks evolved from 2000 to 2024, identify key interdisciplinary authors and fields, and implement link prediction techniques to forecast future collaborations.

## Key Contributions

* **Temporal Evolution:** Built yearly co-authorship graphs to track growth, average degree, clustering, and density. Observed major spikes in 2015 and a shift to tighter collaborations in recent years.

* **Interdisciplinarity:** Quantified using entropy measures and co-field occurrence. Identified key ‚Äúbridge authors‚Äù and visualized field overlaps via heatmaps.

* **Link Prediction:** Implemented Jaccard, Adamic-Adar, and Preferential Attachment methods. Found Adamic-Adar to be the most effective heuristic for predicting future links.

* **Case Study (cs.LG):** Traced the rise of Machine Learning as a collaborative and interdisciplinary research hub, highlighting its integration with multiple domains like CS, statistics, and physics.
